Docker:
-Makes Software instalation and running very easy without worrying about setup or dependencies.
-Docker Client -> responsible to issue commands to server
-Docker Server -> creates images, runs containers, etc
-Docker Container -> Container is not a physical space on your PC. Instead, it is a group of running processes(e.g printing, spotify, chrome, etc)+Kernel+Hard Driver(RAM/CPU, etc)
-Docker Image -> It is like File System snapshot(Application+Software required to run an application) and command to run that application on software(e.g. >run chrome). It is a single file with all the dependencies and configurations to run a program. 
-Relation between Container and Image -> When image is run on the container, the file system snapshot is allocated into Hard Drive. Then startup command is executed. Resources are allocated and alication starts running.

Key commands:
1. Check docker version:
$docker version

2. Start docker on boot(Manual)
$sudo service docker start
Note: Docker service can be made available automatically on boot.

3. Run Hello World Image on docker:
$docker run hello-world
